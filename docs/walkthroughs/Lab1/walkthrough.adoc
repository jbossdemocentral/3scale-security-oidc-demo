:title: Scenario 1 - Creating a secure login using Red Hat SSO

[id='3scale-security-demo'] 
= {title}

//Description text for Solution Pattern
This tutorial demonstrates how to provide a secure access to the accident reporting app without embedding the authentication logic in our application. This is more secure and saves developers a ton of time as they would be using a standard protocol such as OpenID Connect and the proven product such as Red Hat SSO. Red Hat SSO and is already deployed and configured for us on OpenShift.

*Credentials:*

*OpenShift Username*: Use your Red Hat associate SSO credentials to log into the OpenShift console

*OpenShift Password*: Use your Red Hat associate SSO credentials to log into the OpenShift console
